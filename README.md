# WIP: AdvancedWorld - PlaceholderAPI Expansion
## About AdvancedWorld
AdvancedWorld is an expansion for the PlaceholderAPI Spigot plugin. This expansion aims to be a full implementation of the Paper API's world-related get methods. 
AdvancedWorld aims to be a feature-packed expansion, therefore various world-related methods might be added in the future which depend on other plugins to work, such as Vault.
  
*Note that as the Paper API keeps expanding, some methods might be missing. Feel free to create a feature request to have a certain (world-related) get-method added.*

## Dependencies
The PlaceholderAPI plugin. Please see: https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI.

Some placeholders might require a dependency, such as Vault.
## How to install
To-be added.
## Placeholders
Placeholder | Usage | Dependency
------------ | ------------- | -------------
| %world_name& | Retrieve the world name. | None |
## Known Incompatabilities
This expansion is incompatible with any PAPI expansions that make use of the identifier 'world' e.g. `%world_xxx%`.
## Bug Report + Feature Request
To-be added.
## License
To-be added (most-likely GPLV3).
